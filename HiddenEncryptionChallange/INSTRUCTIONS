task2.offset - the offset (in bytes) at which the blob should be
  placed in the output file for Task 2
task3.data - a container file with hidden encrypted data for Task 3
task3.key - the encryption key for the encrypted data in task3.data
task3.ctr - the initial counter value for the encrypted data in task3.data
task4.data - data to hide for Task 4
task4.key - The encryption key for hiding the data in task4.data
task4.ctr - the initial counter value for hiding the data in task4.data
